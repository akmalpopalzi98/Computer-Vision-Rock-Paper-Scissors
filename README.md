#Computer Vision Milestone 2: Creating a system that detects whether the user is showing rock, paper or scissors to a camera

##In this task, a computer vision model was trained on a dataset featuring images of rock, paper and scissors. Each class contained approximately 800+ examples to allow the model to have a better generalization accuracy when making predictions. After the model was trained, it was exported and stored so that it can be later implemented into a python application in the next milestone.
